Since our work is primarily focused in areas where the startup ecosystems are just beginning to grow, we often get questions that have been answered by more veteran investors or founders in more established markets. Inspired by [John Gannon's blog](https://johngannonblog.com/) and instead of finding them one-by-one in my bookmarks, I've decided to start compiling them here in order to make sharing easier.The resources I post are ones that have helped me throughout my career or have been recommended several times over by established founders or VC's. Much like John's blog above, I've posted resources that are also geared to VC only because it's impossible to sell to anyone whom you don't understand well.If I am missing anything or you've found a resource you'd like me to add please comment below. I'll be editing the list regularly as I come across interesting content and subtract the outdated ones.
