title = "Learning from Sunrun’s Vivint Acquisition"

+++
Late last night, word broke that Sunrun had acquired Vivint in an all stock deal. 

Interstingly, Sunrun was mostly championing the reduction in costs instead of the growth potential of the combined entity in a market with only 3% of penetration.

The SG&A of each business are interesting. It appears both businesses have started to stagnate when it comes to turning sales & marketing dollars into revenues.

\**Why might this be happening so soon?** 

1\. Solar is a commodity at it's core. For most people, electricity is electricity. Other than Tesla, there's no "brand" in solar and by brand I mean instant recognition / organic customer acquisiton. This leaves little room for differentation.

2\. Until recently, consumers weren't as informed as informed on emissions and climate, though this is beginning to change rapidly.

3\. Friction in the solar and residential energy market is extremely high. Between the sales process, the financing process, and finally installation the solar purchasing cycle can be confusing for uninformed buyers.

All three of these factors are changing in favor of the solar market which is why I think the public markets have reacted well to the news of the merger. 

\**So, what can we learn about new secotrs of consumer electricity from this merger?**

The gap between innovators (first 2.5% of the market) and early adopters (the next 13.5% of the market) isn't equal across sectors or products. 

Said more specifically, the passion and motvation between the two groups is likely to be significantly different by product. All market growth isn't created equally, and while all markets might cross the chasm, the timeframes in which they do so vary wildly.

Unlike B2C software or CPG, this means the traditional "land grab" strategy potentially exhausts itself much more quickly in complicated markets. 

As a result, the importance of refining your business model and value prop is brought forward into your company's lifecycle.

It's too early to say if this is a trend worth watching, especially since it is so early in the solar industry's lifecycle and these are just two companies in a very fragmented space.

The good news is, the residental solar solar supports at 2 (3 if you count Solar City), billion dollar companies with only minimal market penetration. That's the type of potential that should excite everyone.
