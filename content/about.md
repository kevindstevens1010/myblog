Welcome to my online home. I write, publish a newsletter, and help founders build companies that aspire to change the energy ecosystem forever. I subscribe to the digitial gardening theory of blogging - this is a place for me to think, sometimes in incomplete thoughts, and always with the chance my thoughts will grow over time.


#### Current work 👨🏻‍💻

‍**Investing** — Partner at Intelis Capital

‍**Building** — helping founders build companies & growing the Intelis Capital community
